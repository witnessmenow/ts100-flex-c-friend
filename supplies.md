# Tested Power Supplies

A list of Power supplies that have been tested (feel free to submit a PR with ones you have tried)

**Note:** Some chargers seem to be able to operate at voltages that they should not be able to according to their rated spec. I do not recommend doing this! Chargers that operate out of spec will be labeled with a "(OS!)"
